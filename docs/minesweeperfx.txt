MinesweeperFX Notes & Todos

Todos:
- Implement style changes incl. differentiating revealed tiles with no mines from
  unrevealed tiles (shadow/highlight?)
- Implement menu bar functions
- Implement extra game functions e.g. remaining mines to flag
- Implement check on cell reveal for game state (i.e. win/lose)

1. Finish game functionality
  i. Use pop-up to announce win or loss in a game
    - Win: Every non-mined cell must be revealed. Track remaining mines to be flagged; if it equals zero, check that all non-mine
      cells have been revealed. If an incorrect cell has been flagged, the all non-mine cells reveal check will fail.
    - Lose: If cell is revealed while having a mine, immediate loss. Lock inputs, pop-up to start new game or exit to menu (exit for now)
  ii. Mine counter
    - Keep track of total number of mines, and count down as flags are placed. If a flag is removed, count up. May have to wait for toolbar/
      menu bar to be finished.
  iii. Symbols / Aesthetic
    âœ” Numbers should be colored according to number of nearby mines
    - Symbols for flags & mines - Modest size PNG should be enough.
