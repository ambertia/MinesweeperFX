Basic functionality outline:
- Starting menu to choose difficulty and initiate game
- Game scene with grid of labels / buttons
- Popup window or in-game notification for win/loss/new game

GameContainer: Displayable object to manage active game UI elements, contain and reference
a data manager
GameDataManager: Manage the game state, process changes in game state and retreive cell
information

To-do list:
- Implement function to reveal whole areas of the board with no neighbors: If nearbyMines
  = 0, reveal all neighbors and/or add to waterfall pool?
- New gamestate processor class? Would help split some functionality off of GameContainer & GameDataManager
- Implement style changes incl. differentiating revealed tiles with no mines from
  unrevealed tiles (shadow/highlight?)
- Implement menu bar functions
- Implement extra game functions e.g. remaining mines to flag
- Implement check on cell reveal for game state
