MinesweeperFX Notes & Todos

Todos:
✔ Implement style changes incl. differentiating revealed tiles with no mines from
  unrevealed tiles (shadow/highlight?)
✔ Implement menu bar functions
✔ Implement extra game functions e.g. remaining mines to flag
✔ Implement check on cell reveal for game state (i.e. win/lose)

1. Finish game functionality
  i. Use pop-up to announce win or loss in a game
    ✔ Win: Every non-mined cell must be revealed. Track remaining mines to be flagged; if it equals zero, check that all non-mine
      cells have been revealed. If an incorrect cell has been flagged, the all non-mine cells reveal check will fail.
    ✔ Lose: If cell is revealed while having a mine, immediate loss. Lock inputs, pop-up to start new game or exit to menu (exit for now)
  ii. Mine counter
    ✔ Keep track of total number of mines, and count down as flags are placed. If a flag is removed, count up. May have to wait for toolbar/
      menu bar to be finished.
  iii. Symbols / Aesthetic
    ✔ Numbers should be colored according to number of nearby mines
    ✔ Symbols for flags & mines - Modest size PNG should be enough.

2. UI cleanup & reorg
  i. Add a main menu (likely separate scene)
    - Start Game button
    - Custom difficulty boxes
    - Big title thing
    - Animated background?
  ii. Tool bar upgrade
    - Put mine label on right-hand side
    - Menus for settings when applicable
    - Save & quit button
  iii. Local file I/O
    - How will this work on portable JARs?? File input inside/outside JAR, or on user's system?
    - Save unfinished games to file on close & load on load
    - Save user settings i.e. custom difficulty presets, UI coloration settings
  iv. (probably better to do earlier) Clean up classes, esp MinesweeperGame and order of functions in GameContainer and GameCell
